## 🤔 Why Were These Archived?

1. **Evolution:** The actual implementation evolved differently from early plans
2. **Clarity:** Reducing clutter in the repository root
3. **Professionalism:** Making the repo easier to navigate for reviewers and contributors
4. **Accuracy:** Ensuring only authoritative documentation is prominent

**No content was deleted—only reorganized.**
